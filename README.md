<h2>My Story:</h2>

<b>I am a dedicated and results-driven professional currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance (expected graduation: December â€˜25). My path into technology builds on a foundation of cybersecurity certifications, hands-on technical training, and a successful career as an NYC executive chef â€” where I honed skills in operations management, process optimization, and problem-solving that now complement my security expertise.

In my role as a <strong>Cyber Security Support Technician</strong>, Iâ€™ve gained real-world experience in safeguarding digital infrastructures, risk management, incident response, penetration testing, and regulatory compliance. I work with industry-leading tools such as Microsoft Sentinel, Splunk, and Azure cloud solutions.

With a passion for technology, an eagerness to learn, and a proven ability to adapt and excel, I am committed to ongoing professional development. I seek an opportunity to contribute to an organization that values a self-starter with a track record of success, a love for innovation, and a relentless drive to deliver impactful results.
