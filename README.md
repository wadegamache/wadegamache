<h2>My Story:</h2>

- <b>With over 10 years of leadership and managerial experience, I am a passionate and detail-oriented professional looking to transition from the Hospitality industry to Cybersecurity. I am seeking a better work/life balance with a more traditional schedule. My existing skill set easily traverses industries, including operations management, process optimization, and problem-solving. I have supplemented this with industry-specific education, certifications and projects. These include the Google Cybersecurity Professionals Certificate, CompTIA Security+ Certification, and a Leveled Cybersecurity Masterclass Certificate. With my experience as an Executive Chef in NYC, I thrive in fast-paced, high-pressure environments and excel at quickly identifying and addressing challenges with creative solutions. My ability to learn and educate myself in the workplace is one of my strongest attributes. Above all, my love for technology, endless curiosity, and desire for continual growth make me a perfect fit for those interested in a driven professional with a proven track record for success. </b>
