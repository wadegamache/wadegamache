<h2>My Story:</h2>

<b>I am a dedicated and results-driven professional currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance (expected graduation: May â€˜25). My academic journey builds on my existing cybersecurity certifications, practical education, and a successful career as an NYC executive chef. My hospitality background provided me with valuable skills in operations management, process optimization, and problem-solving, which seamlessly complement my cybersecurity ambitions.

Through my role as a Cyber Security Support Technician and educational experience, I have gained expertise in safeguarding digital infrastructures, risk management, incident response, penetration testing, and regulatory compliance. I have hands-on experience with industry-leading tools and platforms, including SIEM systems, Microsoft Azure, and cloud security solutions. Upon graduation, I will hold certifications such as CompTIA PenTest+, CompTIA CASP+, and CISM, alongside my existing credentials.

With a passion for technology, an eagerness to learn, and a proven ability to adapt and excel, I am committed to ongoing professional development. I seek an opportunity to contribute to an organization that values a self-starter with a track record of success, a love for innovation, and a relentless drive to deliver impactful results.</b>
